# Tic-Tac-Toe Rails
## Getting started
To get started with the app, clone the repo and then install the needed gems:
```sh
$ bundle install
```

Next, migrate the database:

```sh
$ rails db:migrate
```

If the test suite passes, you'll be ready to run the app in a local server:

```sh
$ rails server
```
